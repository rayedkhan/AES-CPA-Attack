# AES-CPA-Attack

This project implements a full Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack against the TINYAES128 software AES-128 implementation to recover its 16-byte secret key purely from side-channel power traces. First, plaintexts (in hex) and their corresponding power measurements are ingested from CSV files using pandas. We then model the intermediate AES state via the Hamming-weight leakage model and compute, for each key-byte hypothesis at every time sample, the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted Hamming weights and measured power. By iterating this byte-wise CPA over all 16 sub-bytes and selecting the candidate with the highest correlation, the full AES key is reconstructed without any knowledge of the implementation internals.

Beyond key recovery, the repository provides end-to-end benchmarking and visualization to quantify and illustrate the attack’s effectiveness. Runtime is measured from trace loading through key output to gauge scalability, while matplotlib plots include the averaged power trace—highlighting points of maximum leakage—and a success-rate curve that charts key-recovery probability as a function of the number of traces. Together, these analyses demonstrate a reproducible, near-100% recovery success rate with a practical number of traces, making this both a teaching tool and a foundation for more advanced side-channel research.
